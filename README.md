## 1. Background
Park It is a fun parking game that lets users control small race car on a full screen. The user's task is to park the car inside a randomly positioned blue parking spot in the shortest amount of time. There are floating stop signs which the user has to avoid and five chances are given. Each time the race car collides with a stop sign, one life is decreased. User has 1.5 second grace period at beginning of the game or restart of the game where the racecar is immune to stop sign collision.

## 2. Functionality & MVP

1. Racecar rendered on screen and user control
2. Stop signs move around at random initial launch angle and velocity
3. Apply phsyics to circle collisions with impulse calculated
4. Collision detection between a rotatable rectangle (racecar) and stop signs
5. Inclusion detection between the parking spot and rotated rectangle (racecar)
6. User loses one life at collision
7. Add timer to game and display best time at successful parking

## 3. Wireframe
